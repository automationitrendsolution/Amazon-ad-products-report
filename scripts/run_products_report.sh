#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Cron wrapper for the Products report.
#
#  * resolves the project directory from this script's own location (absolute);
#  * uses the project's virtualenv interpreter;
#  * passes the protected .env explicitly (python-dotenv loads it -- the file is
#    never sourced by the shell, so passwords with $ or quotes are safe);
#  * takes a non-blocking flock so an overrunning run makes the next one exit
#    instead of overlapping (both cron entries share one browser profile);
#  * exits with the Python process's status, so failures are nonzero.
#
# The date each run loads (today / yesterday) is computed by the
# application in the Amazon account's timezone (AMAZON_ACCOUNT_TIMEZONE); the
# server's and cron's timezone are irrelevant.
