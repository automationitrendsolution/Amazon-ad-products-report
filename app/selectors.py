"""Selector catalogue and resolution helpers.

Amazon ships DOM changes to Campaign Manager without notice, so every element
is addressed by an ordered list of *candidate* selectors loaded from
``config/selectors.json``.  Fixing a broken run is then a config edit, not a
code change and redeploy.

A selector may hold placeholders such as ``{label}`` or ``{n}``; the caller
fills them in (``values={"label": "Yesterday"}``), so one list serves every
date preset or page size.
